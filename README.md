# EarthShuffle

App: https://davbachman.github.io/EarthShuffle/

EarthShuffle is a 3D toroidal slice puzzle where a textured Earth is split into moving cube layers inside a wireframe 3x3x3 cube, with wrapped slice motion and visible interior Earth layers when pieces separate.

Controls:
- Desktop: left-click drag on a cube face to slide a layer, right-click drag to orbit, `Reset` button to restore solved state, `Shuffle` button to apply 20 random moves.
- Mobile: one-finger drag on a cube face to slide a layer, two-finger drag to orbit, `Reset` and `Shuffle` buttons for state control.
